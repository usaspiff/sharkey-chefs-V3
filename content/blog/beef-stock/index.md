### Ingredients

- Several lbs of grassfed beef marrow bones
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 TBSP apple cider vinegar
- Coarsely chopped veggies:
- 1-2 carrots
- 2-3 celery stalks
- 1 medium onion
- Â½ bunch parsley (add at end)
- Water

### Instructions

- Place the bones in a pot or slow cooker. Cover with water and add 1TBPS vinegar. Let soak for 15-20 minutes. (If desired, bones can be roasted in a baking dish at 350 for one hour prior to soaking. This enhances flavor but is not necessary.)
- Add veggies or veggie scraps and bay leaves, and fill your pot with water, leaving at least one inch at the top for liquid to expand.
- If using a slow cooker, set it to low, and let cook for 8-24 hours.
- If using a pot on the stove, bring to a boil, remove scum from top, and then reduce to a simmer for 8-24 hours.
- 15 minutes before you stop cooking, add the parsley.
- Remove from heat, strain out bones and veggies (bones can be saved in the freezer and used again for several cooks).
