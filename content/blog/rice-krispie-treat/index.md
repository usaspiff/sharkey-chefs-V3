Makes one 9-inch square pan

### Ingredients

- 4 cups rice cereal
- 1/2 cup honey
- 1/2 cup Tahini (I like the Once Again Brand - with the Racoon on the label)
- 1/2 teaspoon sea salt

### Instructions

- Line a 9-inch square pan with parchment paper and set aside. In a small saucepan over medium heat, gently bring the honey to a boil and allow it to boil for one minute. Remove the boiled honey from the heat, then stir in the tahini and salt until smooth.
- Place the cereal in a large bowl, then pour the tahini and honey mixture over the top. Stir well, until all of the cereal is thoroughly coated.
- Press the mixture into the prepared pan, and press HARD to pack the bars tightly. Allow the bars to cool completely before slicing and servingâ€“ you can speed up the process by freezing them for about 30 minutes.
- Store in a sealed container in the fridge for best shelf life, and serve chilled or at room temperature.
