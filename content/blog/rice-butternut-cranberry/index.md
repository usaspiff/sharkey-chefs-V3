### Ingredients

- 1/2 medium butternut squash, peeled, seeded and cut into small cubes
- 1-1/2 cup wild rice, rinsed
- 3 cups vegetable stock (or half water, half stock)
- 1/2 large onion, chopped
- 1 cup dried cranberries
- 1/4 cup warm water
- 3 tablespoons chopped Italian parsley
- 1/4 cup + 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1/4 cup lemon juice
- 1/4 cup orange juice
- Salt to taste

### Instructions

- Heat oven to 400 degrees.
- Toss the butternut squash with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, and sprinkle with salt. Spread the squash on a baking sheet. Roast until tender and starting to brown, about 20-25 minutes (check earlier if your pieces are very small).
- Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a medium skillet. Saut√© the onion for 3-4 minutes.
- Place the dried cranberries in a bowl with the warm water. Let sit for 10 minutes, then drain.
- In a medium bowl, whisk together the remaining olive oil, orange juice, and lemon juice.
- Place the wild rice and stock in a medium saucepan. Heat to a boil, then reduce heat, cover and simmer for 40 minutes, or until some of the grains start to split. The rice should still be quite chewy. Drain thoroughly and - place in a large bowl. You can instead cook the rice with the stock in a rice cooker.
- Add the onions, cranberries, parsley and dressing to the wild rice and stir. Gently mix in the roasted squash. - Serve warm if possible, or at room temperature.
