### Ingredients

- 3 cups all-purpose GF flour (I use Bobâ€™s Redmill or King Arthur GF)
- 1/2  cup white sugar
- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 cups mashed ripe bananas. We usually end up with too little banana, and make up the difference with Apple sauce which is always good.
- 1 cup canola oil
- 1 cup coconut milk (I sub hemp or oat and it works fine)

### Instructions

- Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper liners.
- Mix flour, white sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, nutmeg, and salt together in a large bowl. Stir bananas, canola oil, and coconut milk together in a separate bowl; mix banana mixture into flour mixture until just combined. Fill muffin cups with batter.
- Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes.
