Prep Time: 15 minutes
Cook Time: 4 hours, 30 minutes
Yield: Serves 6

### Ingredients

- 1 1/2 pounds beef chuck roast, trimmed of excess fat and sinew
- 1 teaspoon unrefined sea salt
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 8 ounces English-style (find it here) or Canadian Bacon, chopped
- 4 medium carrots, scraped and chopped into 1/2-inch thick rounds
- 4 medium Russet or yukon gold potatoes, peeled and chopped into 1-inch cubes
- 1 cup pearl onions
- 1 quart homemade beef stock (This is good with veggie stock - please see the Veggie stock recipe(link) - and would probably be good with the Pacific organic chicken broth too)
- 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves

### Instructions

- Sprinkle the beef with salt.
- Put bacon in a pan and cook on medium-high for three to five minutes. Allow it to render its fat and brown a bit, drain the excess fat and then toss in the beef and brown on each side about 3 minutes.
- Stir in the vegetables, and stock. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to low and simmer, covered, for 4 to 5 hours until the meat is tender.
- Remove the meat from the pot and shred it with a knife and fork. Return the shredded meat to the pot and increase the temperature to medium-high. Remove the pot's cover, and allow it to simmer until the liquid is reduced by 1/3. Sprinkle with fresh thyme, and serve.

### Notes

To prepare this in a slowcooker, first cook the bacon, brown the meat, then add all the ingredients together and cook on low for 8 hours. If you use a smaller slow cooker, you can use the same meat proportions and reduce the amount of veggies.
